# Legal Playbook: Termination & Exit Strategy

## 1. Objective
To establish clear triggers for ending the relationship while mitigating financial exposure and ensuring operational continuity.

## 2. Standard Clause (Preferred)
> "Either Party may terminate this Agreement for any reason ('Convenience') upon sixty (60) days' prior written notice. Additionally, either Party may terminate immediately 'For Cause' if the other Party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within fifteen (15) days of receipt of notice."

## 3. Negotiation Matrix

| Stance | Scenario | Guidance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Plan A (Aggressive)** | Vendor-Side | No termination for convenience; the Client is locked in for the full initial term. |
| **Plan B (Balanced)** | Standard Service | Termination for convenience allowed for both parties with a 30-90 day notice period. |
| **Plan C (Compromise)** | Client-Side | Termination for convenience allowed, but Client pays a "Termination Fee" equal to 1 month of fees. |
| **The Red Line** | High Risk | **REJECT** clauses that allow the other party to terminate "at will" without notice while you have unrecouped sunk costs. |

## 4. Termination Triggers (The "Why")
- **Material Breach:** Failure to perform core obligations (e.g., non-payment or failure to deliver).
- **Insolvency:** Immediate termination if the other party goes bankrupt or enters liquidation.
- **Change of Control:** Right to terminate if a direct competitor acquires the other party.
- **Force Majeure:** Right to exit if a "God" event lasts longer than 30 consecutive days.

## 5. Post-Termination Obligations (The "Cleanup")
- **Transition Services:** Vendor must provide up to 30 days of "offboarding" support at standard rates.
- **Data Portability:** Ensure all Client data is returned in a usable format (.csv, .json) within 10 days.
- **Accrued Fees:** Client must pay for all services rendered up to the effective date of termination.
- **Survival:** Ensure "Confidentiality" and "Indemnification" clauses stay alive even after the contract dies.
