# Legal Playbook: Intellectual Property (IP)

## 1. Objective
To establish clear ownership, protection, and control of intellectual property rights including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets created during the course of business relationships.

## 2. Standard Clause (Preferred)
> "All Intellectual Property created, developed, or invented by Contractor in connection with the performance of this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive property of Client. Contractor hereby assigns all right, title, and interest in and to such Intellectual Property, including all patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, to Client. Contractor shall execute all documents reasonably necessary to perfect Client's ownership and shall cooperate in registering such Intellectual Property in Client's name."

## 3. Negotiation Matrix

| Stance | Scenario | Guidance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Plan A (Aggressive)** | Client-Friendly | All work product, including pre-existing tools, is assigned to Client. Contractor retains no rights. |
| **Plan B (Balanced)** | Mutual Development | Client owns deliverables; Contractor retains rights to pre-existing tools and general methodologies used. Define carve-outs clearly. |
| **Plan C (Compromise)** | Contractor-Favorable | Client receives license to deliverables; Contractor retains ownership. Include non-compete restrictions on Contractor's use. |
| **The Red Line** | High Risk | **REJECT** any assignment of Client's pre-existing IP to Contractor. Ensure clear distinction between Contractor's background IP and newly created IP. |

## 4. Mandatory Inclusions

### A. Ownership Clarification
- **Work-for-Hire:** Explicitly state whether engagement is "work-for-hire" under copyright law.
- **Background IP:** Define what IP existed prior to engagement (Contractor's background IP).
- **New IP:** Define what constitutes "New IP" created during the engagement.
- **Hybrid IP:** Address derivative works and improvements to existing IP.

### B. Registration & Formalities
- Obligation to register IP (patents, trademarks, copyrights) in Client's name.
- Cost allocation for registration and maintenance.
- Cooperation requirement for obtaining international protection.

### C. Moral Rights Waiver
- Contractor waives moral rights (attribution, integrity) to the extent permitted by law.
- Specify jurisdiction for enforceability (varies by country).

### D. Warranty of Non-Infringement
- Contractor warrants that deliverables do not infringe third-party IP.
- Include indemnification clause for breach of warranty.

## 5. Common Carve-Outs & Exceptions

The following should typically be excluded from IP assignment:
- **Contractor's Pre-Existing Tools:** Code, frameworks, libraries created before engagement.
- **General Skills & Know-How:** Industry knowledge, methodologies, techniques.
- **Third-Party Components:** Open-source software, licensed libraries (must list explicitly).
- **Client's Pre-Existing Materials:** Client retains all rights to materials provided to Contractor.

## 6. Survival & Termination
- **Perpetual:** IP assignments are typically perpetual unless specifically limited.
- **Licensing Rights:** If Contractor retains background IP, grant non-exclusive, royalty-free license to Client for use within deliverables.
- **Post-Termination Obligations:** Contractor shall return or destroy all confidential materials and Client IP.
- **Remedy:** Include **Injunctive Relief** clause for unauthorized use or disclosure of registered IP.

## 7. Special Considerations

### Patents
- Include explicit assignment language: "Contractor shall promptly disclose and assign all patent rights."
- Address provisional patents, continuation applications, and international filings.
- Define cost responsibility for prosecution (typically Client for newly created IP).

### Open Source Software
- Require disclosure of all open-source dependencies.
- Define acceptable licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD typically acceptable; GPL may require review).
- Include indemnity for violations of open-source license terms.

### Trade Secrets & Confidential Information
- IP assignment applies to trade secrets; ensure overlap with Confidentiality clause is clear.
- Include specific protections for handling and storage of trade secret IP.

### Trademarks
- Client retains exclusive control of trademark use and licensing.
- Contractor prohibited from registering trademarks that may create confusion with Client's brand.

## 8. Red Flags & Negotiation Points

| Issue | Risk | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ownership ambiguity | Disputes over who owns IP created | Define "New IP" precisely; use work-for-hire language where applicable |
| Joint ownership | Creates deadlock; requires both parties' consent to license | Avoid joint ownership; assign all rights to one party with compensation if needed |
| Contractor retains all rights | Client receives no protection | Minimum: exclusive license to Client for deliverable use |
| No warranty of non-infringement | Client liable for third-party infringement claims | Require Contractor warranty and indemnification |
| Inadequate carve-out documentation | Disputes over what's pre-existing vs. new | Require Contractor to list all background IP upfront (Exhibit A) |
| Ambiguous scope of assignment | "All IP" may not include future developments | Specify scope: "all IP created solely by Contractor in performance of Services" |
