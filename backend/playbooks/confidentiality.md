# Legal Playbook: Confidentiality & Non-Disclosure (NDA)

## 1. Objective
To protect proprietary data, trade secrets, and sensitive business information from unauthorized disclosure or use by third parties.

## 2. Standard Clause (Preferred)
> "Recipient shall maintain the Confidential Information in strict confidence and shall not disclose, reveal, or communicate such information to any third party without Discloser's prior written consent. Recipient shall use the same degree of care to protect the Confidential Information as it uses to protect its own sensitive information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care."

## 3. Negotiation Matrix

| Stance | Scenario | Guidance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Plan A (Aggressive)** | Unilateral NDA | Define "Confidential Information" broadly to include all verbal and written data. |
| **Plan B (Balanced)** | Mutual NDA | Include "Need-to-Know" exceptions for employees, legal counsel, and financial advisors. |
| **Plan C (Compromise)** | Regulatory | Explicitly allow disclosure if required by law/court order, provided notice is given to the Discloser. |
| **The Red Line** | High Risk | **REJECT** any "Residuals" clause that allows the Recipient to use info "retained in the memory" of their staff. |

## 4. Mandatory Exclusions
The following must be excluded from confidentiality obligations:
- Information already in the **public domain**.
- Information **rightfully known** by Recipient prior to disclosure.
- Information **independently developed** without use of the Discloser's data.
- Information received from a **third party** with no secrecy obligation.

## 5. Survival & Termination
- **Standard Term:** 3 to 5 years post-termination.
- **Trade Secrets:** Protection must be **indefinite** or as long as the information remains a secret under applicable law.
- **Remedy:** Include a clause for **Injunctive Relief** (the right to stop the leak via court order) rather than just suing for money.
